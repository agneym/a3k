It may not expand at any time during the match beyond this size even for hitting the ball. Violating this clause will lead to immediate disqualification.<br/>The bots should be controlled manually using laptop or pc only.<br/>Teams can use both on board and off board circuits for communication with computer<br/>The bots can have on board as well as off board power supply. Teams will be provided 220 volts 50 Hz AC supply.<br/>The maximum potential difference between any two points on the bot should not exceed 24 volts.<br/>Grabbing the ball is not allowed. So bots should not have any kind of grabbing mechanisms.<br/>GAME-PLAY<br/>Teams will have to play a football match against other team.
